Week 1

This week I implemented the assigned "useless kernel assignment". I had some
difficulties translating elements from the older 2.X kernel to the 4.X kernel
for which I compiled the system. This was useful information and was some good
review on the material involved in the procfs system as well as the workqueue
and delayed_workqueue updates.
